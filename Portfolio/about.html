    <h1 id="h1"> About Me</h1>
        <p id="p1"> My name is Johanna Figueroa I am Salvadorian and Mexican. I have a three year old sister named Melany. I enjoy doing community service as well as helping others in any task. I attend Making Waves Academy and I live in Richmond. I participate in American Sign Language Club, Maker's Club and am currently a secretary in a club called KIWIN'S. One thing I think should be known about me is that I am very resilient, hard-working and perserverant. Not only am I involved in clubs but I also really enjoy playiing softball when the season starts. </p>
