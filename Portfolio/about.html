    <h1 id="h1"> About Me</h1>
        <p id="p1"> My name is Johanna Figueroa and I am a student at Making Waves Academy. I am both Mexican and Salvadorian. My family consists of my mom, dad, and my little sister. My family in my perspective is who keeps me grounded. Some things outside of my family that is part of my education are clubs and activities I do at school. Some examples of clubs I participate in are American Sign Language Club, Maker's Club, and I am currently a secretary in a club called KIWIN'S. Some of the activies that I enjoy doing is volunteering,doing community service, and being part of the softball team. Some thing that should be known about me is that I am resilient, hard-working, and perseverant. In the future I want to be able to major in criminology and be able to accomplish my goal of being able to provide for my family. </p>
